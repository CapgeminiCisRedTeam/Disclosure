# **CVE-2025-51629 - Eccobook - Reflected Cross-site scripting (XSS)**

### Description
A Reflected Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in Agenzia Impresa Eccobook v2.81.1 was found which allows an attacker to execute arbitrary Javascript code via a crafted payload injected into the `DocumentoId`, `CommittenteId`, `Temp` parameters.
### Affected Product Code Base
* Agenzia Impresa Eccobook v2.81.1 and below

### Attack Vectors
In order to exploit the vulnerability, an unauthenticated attacker should send a malicious crafted link to the victim.
User interaction from the victim is required.

### Discovered by
Simone Aiello

## **Proof-of-Concept (POC)**
The parameter DocumentoId is reflected inside the application response without proper validation/sanitization, an attacker can therefore craft a malicious url such as:
```
https://REDACTED/Pages/PdfViewer.aspx?DocumentoId=<svg/onload=alert()>&CommittenteId=46
60
```
And, by phishing techniques, the following URL can be sent to user with admin access to execute custom JavaScript under the context of the administrator.
By clicking on the link, we can notice how the alert is triggered:

The same vulnerability is present also on the parameters `CommittenteId`, `Temp` and `Nome`.
