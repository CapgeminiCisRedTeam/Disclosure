# CVE-2023-41640 | RealGimm by GruppoSCAI - Information disclosure
An information disclosure caused by improper error handling has been found in RealGimm version 1.1.37p38. What follows is a description of the steps taken to perform the exploit.
## Proof of Concept
Every unhandled exception in the application is redirected to this webpage *ErroreNonGestito.aspx*, that is used to display them. For example, the following error is caused by an SQL malformed query. Clearly, this kind of information should not be exposed to the users, as it reveals sensitive technical information such as column names or database structures.

Similarly, trying to perform a file upload operation without specifying any file, it is possible to cause a verbose error containing the complete file path of the target web application.
