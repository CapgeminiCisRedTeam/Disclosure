# **CVE-2023-46496 - Audimex - Reflected Cross-site Scripting (XSS)**

### Description
The application fails to validate the injected payload submitted by an authenticated user. Several parameters have been found reflected without any validation in the later response, for example *filter\_[company\_name]\_news\_[company\_name]\_news\_title* can be injected with the sample payload reported below to obtain a reflected Cross-Site Scripting, reflected in the *window['official\_params'] and*  *window['short\_params']* variables.  Specifically, the payload is concatened in the reflected JSON without any type of filtering allowing an attacker to continue the JSON injecting a custom JavaScript payload.
The payload can be used to execute action on the user's behalf (such as reset password), also create a phishing scenario to get valid credentials or try to execute screenshot to exfiltrate data. 

### Affected Product Code Base
* Audimex 15.0.0

### Attack Vectors
Inect the sample payload into filtering parameters.

### Sample payload:

```dftsafsd%22";alert(document.domain);//```

### Discovered by
Arcangelo Saracino

## **Proof-of-Concept (POC)**
