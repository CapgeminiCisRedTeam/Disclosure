# CVE-ID | RealGimm by GruppoSCAI - Stored Cross-site Scripting
A stored cross-site scripting vunerability was found in RealGimm version 1.1.37p38. What follows is a description of the steps taken to perform the exploit.

## Proof of Concept
To reach the vulnerable page, first select "Patrimonio" from the main menu, then "Comunicazione", "Modelli Comunicazione" and finally click on "Ente" icon.

![Patrimonio, comunicazione, modelli](https://github.com/CapgeminiCisRedTeam/Disclosure/assets/132057950/a971428a-d2a3-40f0-a901-08d2dea06467)

In the new screen that opens, click on the "Carica Immagine..." link
![Carica immagine](https://github.com/CapgeminiCisRedTeam/Disclosure/assets/132057950/21730132-a27c-4c2c-8e21-f0379d0b70c7)

In order to exploit the vulnerability, instead of an image we can upload a page containing the following Cross-site scripting (stored) payload:
```
<html><body>script>alert(document.domain)</script></body></html>
```
Below the intercepted request and response:
![Request and response](https://github.com/CapgeminiCisRedTeam/Disclosure/assets/132057950/91f883f9-06e2-4734-8de3-9cd9d6069341)

Once the file has been uploaded, select it from those available and click on the green check to add it to the email body:
![Attaching the file](https://github.com/CapgeminiCisRedTeam/Disclosure/assets/132057950/19291b1a-d6f3-4183-961b-6d785bf41fb0)

Let's save the model to make it permanent:

Below the intercepted request and response used to attach the previously uploaded file to the emailâ€™s body:
![Request and response](https://github.com/CapgeminiCisRedTeam/Disclosure/assets/132057950/2206d696-bebc-498e-81fb-0f50afdbb4de)

As can be seen above, the malicious page containing the Cross-site scripting (stored) payload is present and available on the file system underlying the target web application, thus confirming the existence of the vulnerability. If we try to load the above page in a web browser we can see that the code is running correctly in the context of the current user:
![Cross-site scripting executed](https://github.com/CapgeminiCisRedTeam/Disclosure/assets/132057950/909740fc-616c-43e2-883c-660cfd72d04e)

Furthermore, the uploaded file is also available to other users of the web application. Below is the execution of the same payload in the context of another user (victim):
