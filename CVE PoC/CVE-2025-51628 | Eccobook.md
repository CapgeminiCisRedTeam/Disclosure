# **CVE-2025-51628 - Eccobook - Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR)**

### Description
An Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) vulnerability was found in the PdfHandler component in Agenzia Impresa Eccobook v2.81.1 and below allowing an unauthenticated attacker to read confidential documents via the `DocumentId` parameter.
### Affected Product Code Base
* Agenzia Impresa Eccobook v2.81.1 and below

### Attack Vectors
To exploit the vulnerability, an unauthenticated attacker can directly access the URLs where the documents are located by brute-forcing the `DocumentId` parameter.

### Discovered by
Simone Aiello

## **Proof-of-Concept (POC)**
The vulnerable endpoint is the following:
```
https://REDACTED/Handler/PdfHandler.ashx?DocumentoId={id}
```
The vulnerable parameter is `DocumentoId`, which is an integer incremented at each upload, and therefore it is guessable by an attacker. An unauthenticated attacker can therefore bruteforce this parameter in order to access all the documents that have been uploaded.
