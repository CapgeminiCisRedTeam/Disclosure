# CVE-2023-39558 | AudimexEE v.15.0 - Multiple Reflected Cross-Site Scripting

During a penetration test activity, we found several **reflected cross-site scripting** on the **AudimexEE v.15.0** product.

### Overview
[AudimexEE](https://www.web-audimex.com/audimexee) is an audit software solution for large enterprises that fulfils highest demands in terms of the implementation of auditing processes and corporate structures surrounding a powerful and highly flexible audit universe.

## Proof of Concept

### PoC#1
|  |  |
|-----------|-----------|
|**Vulnerable URL**|https://[AUDIMEX-HOST]/audimex/cgi-bin/wal.fcgi|
|**Vulnerable parameter**|filter\_kai\_kai\_tenant\_shortcut, filter\_kai\_kai\_au\_process\_code, filter\_kai\_kai\_au\_risk\_code, filter\_kai\_kai\_ra\_impact, filter\_kai\_kai\_date\_ref, filter\_kai\_kai\_traffic\_light\_rating, filter\_kai\_detail\_kai\_detail\_kai\_code, filter\_kai\_detail\_kai\_detail\_kai\_name, filter\_kai\_detail\_kai\_detail\_tenant\_shortcut, filter\_kai\_detail\_kai\_detail\_au\_process\_code, filter\_kai\_detail\_kai\_detail\_au\_risk\_code, filter\_kai\_detail\_kai\_detail\_ra\_impact, filter\_kai\_detail\_kai\_detail\_kai\_value\_type, filter\_kai\_detail\_kai\_detail\_kai\_comment|
|**HTTP Method**|GET|
|**Authentication Required**|Yes|

After authenticating on the AudimexEE v.15 portal with a “normal user”,

As can be seen in the following images, the target web application is vulnerable to cross-site scripting due to the lack of sanitization of user input.
In particular, the web app is vulnerable at all points where the parameters listed in the table above are present. Below is a demonstration of a point where the vulnerable parameters are used.
To access the vulnerable functionality go to: “Audit management -> audit universe -> show kai data -> settings button”.

![image](https://github.com/CapgeminiCisRedTeam/AudimexCVE/assets/132057950/cf996439-50cc-4b52-b938-8f202a1a7f4c)

Then select all columns from the menu and click on “Apply”.

At this point, using the Burp proxy, we intercept the call to the backend and change the original POST requst to GET, as shown in the following pictures.

![image](https://github.com/CapgeminiCisRedTeam/AudimexCVE/assets/132057950/7e06f880-1020-4a03-8675-4adebd4d1dd9)

To use Burp's 'change request method' functionality, simply right-click on the original request and click on the functionality.

The next image shows the modified request.

It is now sufficient to insert the Cross-Site scripting payload with URL Encoding inside the vulnerable parameters:
**</script><script>alert(1)</script>**

And so cross-site scripting is exploited.
### PoC#2
|  |  |
|-----------|-----------|
|**Vulnerable URL**|https://[AUDIMEX-HOST]/audimex/cgi-bin/wal.fcgi|
|**Vulnerable parameter**|upload\_kai\_import|
|**HTTP Method**|POST|
|**Authentication Required**|Yes|

After authenticating on the AudimexEE v.15 portal with a “normal user”.

![image](https://github.com/CapgeminiCisRedTeam/AudimexCVE/assets/132057950/9d33f598-6f78-4de7-bee9-77b181e80e65)

As can be seen in the following images, the target web application is vulnerable to cross-site scripting due to the lack of sanitization of user input.
In particular, the vulnerability can be exploited through the 'Import Kai Data' excel file upload functionality.
To access the vulnerable functionality go to: “Audit management -> audit universe -> Import Kai Data”.

![image](https://github.com/CapgeminiCisRedTeam/AudimexCVE/assets/132057950/7ee0d11e-4e37-4c3f-b53a-c9633ac6c939)

Here is an example of excel input to trigger vulnerability.

At this point, the file can be uploaded using the appropriate functionality:

![image](https://github.com/CapgeminiCisRedTeam/AudimexCVE/assets/132057950/e11e92c5-e2ae-457a-a955-f842f6cf61a0)

![image](https://github.com/CapgeminiCisRedTeam/AudimexCVE/assets/132057950/2fb121eb-2501-4081-9c7e-c8857f191410)

![image](https://github.com/CapgeminiCisRedTeam/AudimexCVE/assets/132057950/7086503c-e343-45b4-b183-41fd3219c160)

As can be seen in the next image, the javascript code is correctly interpreted and executed.

![image](https://github.com/CapgeminiCisRedTeam/AudimexCVE/assets/132057950/3cd4c8b4-8e0a-4b99-8427-448f51a2862f)

And finally the code is correctly executed.

NOTE: For the sake of brevity, the exploitation of the vulnerability has only been shown for one parameter, but all the others shown in the table above are vulnerable in the same way.

## Suggested Remediation
Preventing cross-site scripting is trivial in some cases but can be much harder depending on the complexity of the application and the ways it handles user-controllable data.

In general, effectively preventing XSS vulnerabilities is likely to involve a combination of the following measures:

- **Filter input on arriva**l. At the point where user input is received, filter as strictly as possible based on what is expected or valid input.
- **Encode data on output**. At the point where user-controllable data is output in HTTP responses, encode the output to prevent it from being interpreted as active content. Depending on the output context, this might require applying combinations of HTML, URL, JavaScript, and CSS encoding.
- **Use appropriate response headers**. To prevent XSS in HTTP responses that aren't intended to contain any HTML or JavaScript, you can use the Content-Type and X-Content-Type-Options headers to ensure that browsers interpret the responses in the way you intend.
- **Content Security Policy**. As a last line of defense, you can use Content Security Policy (CSP) to reduce the severity of any XSS vulnerabilities that still occur.

Also, we strongly recommend looking at the OWASP page that provide further details about the remediation:
