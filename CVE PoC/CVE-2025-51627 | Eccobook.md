# **CVE-2025-51627 - Eccobook - Improper Access Control**

### Description
Improper Access Control in CaricaVerbale in Agenzia Impresa Eccobook v2.81.1 allows an authenticated attacker with low-level access to perform high privileged actions.
### Affected Product Code Base
* Agenzia Impresa Eccobook v2.81.1 and below

### Attack Vectors
To exploit the vulnerability, an unauthenticated attacker can invoke the appropriate endpoint using a low-privilege user to access functionality intended only for high-privilege users

### Discovered by
Simone Aiello

## **Proof-of-Concept (POC)**
To replicate this PoC two users are needed, one with admin privileges and one with low
privileges, for the sake of this PoC they will be referred to as:
* lowpriv@eccosolution.it
* highpriv@eccosolution.it

Although via front-end the user lowpriv@eccosolution.it has read-only permissions, if, by using a web proxy such as Burp Suite, the flow for uploading a new document to a book is repeated with the read-only user's session cookies, the checks on the front-end can be effectively bypassed and the operation is successful.
