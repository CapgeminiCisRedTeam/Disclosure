## **Proof-of-Concept (POC)**

By Navigating the target website, I’ve noticed that any string in the URI path after `/now/nav/ui/classic/params/target/` is inserted in the `src` attribute of an `iframe`.

So the attacker could craft a malicious Javascript code within the URI path and send a malicious website to the victim.
When the victim tries to open the malicious link with the crafted payload, the attacker could execute a malicious Javascript code.
